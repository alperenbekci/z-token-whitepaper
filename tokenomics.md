# TOKENOMICS

We have created Z tokens as a medium of exchange for all services on our platforms. Z tokens can be used to pay for trade commissions in our ﬁrﬆ phase. During later phases, Z can be ﬆaked to earn more platform rewards which we will announce on a later date.

Below are the full details of Z tokens:

| Token Issuer       | Zebacus                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Token Name         | Z Tokens                |
| Token Symbol       | Z                       |
| Total Tokens       | 4,000,000,000,000,000 Z |
| Target Circulation | 2,000,000,000,000,000 Z |
| Decimals           | 18                      |
| Token Type         | ERC-20, Matic, BEP20    |

Users that have enabled paying trade commission using Z tokens will enjoy a 50% discount.

Example:

If Z’s market price is at USD 0.0005

| Total Commission | Paid without using Z | Paid using Z        |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Token Type       | USD 10.00            | USD 5.00 = 20,000 Z |

All calculations are done automatically when trade is executed. If the user does not hold suﬃcient Z Token at the time of trade, the full trade commission will be charged inﬆead.

The discount value will be reduced after the 1ﬆ Year of our launch and subsequent years based on the schedule below:

| 1ﬆ Year      | 2nd Year     | 3rd Year       | 4th Year       |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| 50% Discount | 25% Discount | 12.5% Discount | To be reviewed |

In the 4th Year, we will review whether to discontinue the discounts or maintain at a certain percentage based on our user feedback and Zebacus recommendations.
