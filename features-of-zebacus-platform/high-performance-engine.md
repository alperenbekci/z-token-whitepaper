# HIGH PERFORMANCE ENGINE

A high-performance trading engine is needed in today’s exchanges to handle the higher number of requeﬆs and loads from users. It is the heart of Zebacus platforms that has been built and reﬁned over many years of research and development. The engine performance is at levels of 1 million transactions per second, which is much higher than traditional exchanges ﬆandards. With this engine, we can guaran- tee that users’ orders are executed without lag or delay during major market movements. Our servers are located in diﬀerent geolocations to balance the load during peak times as well.
