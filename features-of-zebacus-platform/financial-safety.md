# FINANCIAL SAFETY

The safety of our users’ funds is our utmoﬆ priority; therefore, we have employed bank-level funds segregation, safety precautions and disaﬆer-proof deployments to make sure that the funds are always protected. Keys and passwords are ﬆored in multiple locations with multi-level approval needed and paper trail records always in place. Users can have a peace of mind when it comes to the security of their funds.
