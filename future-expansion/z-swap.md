# Z SWAP

Z Swap will be a decentralized exchange that lives on Ethereum Network and the ZEBACUS Smart Chain. It will also use automated market maker (AMM) smart contracts to create liquidity pools of both ERC-20 tokens and Z-20 tokens. This allows users to trade using an algorithm versus an order book used on conventional exchanges. Prices are determined as per the market condition and also this ensures reserves ﬆay in relative equilibrium. Z Swap reserves are pooled amongﬆ liquidity providers who supply the exchange with tokens in exchange for a share of the transaction fee. ZEBACUS Swap utilizes regiﬆry contracts to facilitate an exchange between diﬀerent cryptocurrencies. The syﬆem mechanics ensure trades between cryptocurrencies are based on their relative supply.

The platform will be easy to use, supports privacy, and oﬀers lower gas fees. Z swap is currently being developed for market participants and performs exceptionally well. In addition, with the help of the well-designed interactive interface and easy click options on the ZEBACUS platform, it will provide users with a one-ﬆop trading experience.
