# Z POS PLATFORM

Globally, about 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked—without an account at a ﬁnancial inﬆitution or through a mobile money provider. In developing countries, that number is even higher. Because account ownership is nearly universal in high-income economies, virtually all unbanked adults live in developing economies. China and India, despite having relatively high account ownership, claim large shares of the global unbanked population because of their sheer size. Home to 225 million adults without an account, China has the world’s largeﬆ unbanked population, followed by India (190 million), Pakiﬆan (100 million), and Indonesia (95 million). Indeed, these four economies, together with three others—Nigeria, Mexico, and Bangladesh—are home to nearly half the world’s unbanked population.

Despite the advances in ﬁnancial technology over the laﬆ few decades, access to simple, 21ﬆ-century ﬁnancial utilities remains aﬆonishingly limited. Payment terminals have long, ineﬃcient application processes, hiﬆorically inadequate connectivity, and prohibitively expensive card payment coﬆs to juﬆify functioning in anything other than cash. Likewise, service providers have seen no need to inveﬆ in the infraﬆructure needed to connect these billions of individuals to the current digital ﬁnancial syﬆem.
