# REMITTANCE

Money transfer across international borders is ﬆill coﬆly, time-consuming, and potentially risky. Exiﬆing money transfer syﬆems in emerging nations, in particular, are plagued by high transaction coﬆs, protract- ed delays, counterparty risks and 20th-century bureaucracy. In these areas, an eﬆimated two billion people are underbanked, with limited or no access to ﬁnancial services. Providing relevant platform and services to these people is an important ﬆep toward alleviating poverty and foﬆering long-term, wealth-generating local economies.

More than 300 million individuals now reside in a country other than their native country, nearly 50 percent rise since 2000. The total number of international migrants was 65 percent, or nearly 165 million, in high-income nations. In comparison to 58 percent of the global population, 74 percent of all foreign migrants are of working age, ranging from 20 to 64. These migrants are responsible for about $700 billion in annual remittances, where remittance is deﬁned as a money transfer from a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country. Remittances to low and middle-income countries are projected to have grown a ﬆrong 7.3 percent to reach $589 billion in 2021. Much has changed and much has remained conﬆant since the advent of international remittances.

Despite the current focus on purely digital remittance induﬆry disruptors, a physical agent network is critical to the overall process for the vaﬆ majority of senders. Even with the advent of online money transfers, a remittance company cannot compete on a large scale without a ﬆrong agent network. Agents’ assiﬆ remittance service providers by acting as a public face for money senders and recipients in local communities. Using the mechanism oﬀered by the Z token, the user themselves can act as an agents to send money. The responsibilities will shift away from collecting money and transferring the funds through the remittance businesses' mechanism to Z token mechanism.

The transfer process moves online and includes the ability of diﬆributing the fund among the transacting parties using digital funds in form of Z token which is controlled by the client and at a very negligible processing and transaction coﬆ and time.
