# ZEBACUS CHARITY

ZEBACUS is a one-of-a-kind cryptocurrency that allows inveﬆors to actively participate in the saving of children's lives.

The donation will be sent directly to the charity wallet. The funds will subsequently be utilized to make various charities, such as "UNICEF."

We are conﬆantly forming new alliances with other charities to expand current and future prospects. As part of ZEBACUS development into mainﬆream media, we've been in contact with a number of news outlets, allowing us to reach a wider audience than any other charity token project on the market.

Every transaction adds to the frozen liquidity pool by default. This increases the liquidity even further.

The money received for charity is used entirely for philanthropic purposes. It isn't used in any other context. 10% of circulating coin will be diﬆributed for charity.
