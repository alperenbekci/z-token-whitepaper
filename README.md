# INTRODUCTION - BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES

Although the concept of supplemental or digital currencies is not new, the idea of open-source money without a central point of trust, such as a central diﬆribution agency or ﬆate-led control is new. A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptography to safeguard transactions, govern the production of new value units, and validate asset transfers. The choice of the consensus process, latency, and cryptographic hashing techniques are juﬆ a few examples of diﬀerences between cryptocurrencies.

There are 80 million blockchain wallets globally which is a fraction of the global population of 7.9 billion i.e., only a 1% of total people worldwide. Billions of people ﬆill awaiting to join the blockchain revolution which is currently happening. Among the population many have already adopted to the new revolution.

At their core, tokens are entries in diﬆributed ledgers that are assigned to blockchain accounts for which transactions require authorization, ensuring authenticity and preventing modiﬁcation and tampering without consent. Once authorized by the associated accounts, token transactions are validated, encapsulated, and published to the ledger into blocks by blockchain nodes. In general-purpose smart contract platforms, accounts are either internal to the blockchain (i.e., smart contracts) or external or owned through public-key cryptography (i.e., end user-controlled). In the latter case, authorizations are provided by signing the blockchain transactions with the owner’s private key(s), which are generally held in cuﬆody in digital wallets.
