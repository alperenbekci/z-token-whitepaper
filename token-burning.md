# TOKEN BURNING

We believe that maintaining a market equilibrium is very important therefore our target circulation for Z tokens is 2,000,000,000,000,000 tokens. Our reserve tokens will be used to help with the token burning schedule. Trading commissions generated will be burned and reserve tokens will be used to replenish the corresponding number of tokens. This will continue for another 5 years, or until the total sale and commission for all tokens hits 50%. If there are any tokens remaining in the wallet at the completion of the ﬁve years, the remainder will be burned at the 5th year end.

All token burns will be announced, and transaction ID will be poﬆed as well as the associated dead wallet address. Zebacus reserves the right to amend the schedule based on the number of circulating tokens at the time.
