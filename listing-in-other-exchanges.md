# LISTING IN OTHER EXCHANGES

While it is not normal for exchange tokens of one platform to be liﬆed in another platform, nevertheless we are planning to have some tokens swaps with other platforms. For example, Exchange A will liﬆ our tokens and in return we will liﬆ Exchange A’s platform tokens. This is subjected to our regulator’s approval on the liﬆing of Exchange A’s tokens and we will perform our due diligence as well on wherever our tokens are liﬆed.
